# Ardunio Mini Project Code
This is the code that was created during the mini project by the localization and controls team

# SEED_mini_proj.ino
This is the main code that runs on our ardiuno. It receives desired position data from the pi and moves the motors to that position.

# motor_control.slx
This is the simulink model for our motors that we used to create a position controller. We ran this and used the tune function of the PI controller to find our PI values.
